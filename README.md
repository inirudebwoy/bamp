What does it do?
=====================
Bamp saves you precious time by bamping version in all configured files, creating commit and tag (coming this fall) with one simple command.
Bamp follows [SemVer](http://semver.org/) when bamping versions, bringing a bit of sanity into the world of dependencies.

Quick start
==============
Easiest way to explain how to start is with examples of how to use Bamp.
Imagine a developer of a fresh library called *notlob* who has just started and is about
to release his first version. Bamp for *notlob* is configured with location of files
to bamp and the current version to minimise the effort.

* increasing the `minor` part of the version.

        $ bamp minor
        New version: 0.1.0

* increasing the `patch` part of the version.

        $ bamp patch
        New version: 0.1.1

* increasing the `major` part of the version.

        $ bamp major
        New version: 1.0.0

* increasing the `minor` part of the version with git commit.

        $ bamp minor --commit
        New version: 1.1.0

* increasing the `patch` part of the version with git commit and custom message.

        $ bamp patch --commit --message "Bamping!"

* outputting the new version number without actually changing files.

        $ bamp patch --dry-run

* outputting current version only (implies `--dry-run`).
  
        $ bamp current

Configuration
=================

Configuration of bamp is stored in INI format. First place where bamp checks
for configuration is `bamp.cfg` in the current directory. If `bamp.cfg` can't be located
bamp checks for `bamp` section in `setup.cfg`.

Example `bamp.cfg` config file.

    [bamp]
    version=0.0.1
    files=
        setup.py
        src/__init__.py
    vcs=git
    commit=True
    message=Bamp version: {current_version} -> {new_version}
    allow_dirty=False
    tag=True
    tag_name={new_version}

All the options can be passed as arguments to `bamp` executable. If one would like
to bamp minor part in a file with custom message would do it like this.

    bamp minor --version 2.15.10 --files setup.py --commit --message "Bamping!"

As a bit of extra goodness it partially supports configuration used by [bumpversion]() software. Path files defined in *bumpversion* format will be honoured by *bamp* and updated accordingly. You may simply point *bamp* at the configuration file or let it seek for expected file names.


allow_dirty | -a/--allow-dirty
-------------------------------------
Flag indicating if bamp can create a commit in a dirty repository.

    allow_dirty=False

commit | -c/--commit
------------------------
Flag for creating a commit. If set to true bamp will use a default commit message or
use one provided via `-m/--message` argument or taken from the config file.

    commit=True

files | -f/--files
----------------------
List of path files which will be bamped. It is possible to specify more than one path.
`bamp` will check if each of the paths exists before proceeding.

    files=
        setup.py
        src/__init__.py

message | -m/--message
---------------------------
Commit message to be used when bamping.

    message=Bamp version: {current\_version} -> {new\_version}

Following variables will be substituted:
* current_version - for the version before bamping
* new_version - for the version after bamping

tag | -t/-tag
----------------
Flag for creating a tag. If set to true bamp will use a default tag message or
use one provided via `-T/--tag-name` argument or taken from the config file.

    tag=True

tag_name | -T/--tag-name
-----------------
Tag name to be used when bamping.

    tag_name={new\_version}

Following variables will be substituted:
* current_version - for the version before bamping
* new_version - for the version after bamping


vcs | -V/--vcs
-----------------
Set version control which is used. Only git is supported at this time.

    vcs=git

version | -v/--version
---------------------------
This allows to set the version number. This number will be seeked in files and
bamped accordingly. Bamp fails if the version can not be located.

    version=0.1.0
